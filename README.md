# Unity Fractal Explorer
 


<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## About The Project

This program is a proof-of-concept program. I wanted to learn about the intricacies of different popular fractal equations and how they are built through code.  In this program, the user can zoom into the infamous Mandelbrot set, or skew the variables in the equation and explore a fractal of their making. To generate and zoom into the fractal, this program uses Unity's shader system that utilizes GPU calculations. The program can change the values and bounds of the shader equation thus updating the image live.


### Built With Unity

I ended up using the Unity engine due to my familiarity with the engine and it's ease with built-in shader support.

## How to use

Download and run the Fractal Explorer.exe. 
The controls are:
 - Left Mouse Button: Zoom in
 - Right Mouse Button: Zoom out
 - WASD keys: Move frame position
 - Q/E: Change variables in Mandlebrot equation
 - R: Reset variables to original Mandlebrot equation
 - Space: Reset frame position and zoom
