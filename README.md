# Unity Fractal Explorer
 
## This program is a proof-of-concept program. I wanted to learn about the intricacies of different popular fractal equations and how they are built through code. I ended up using ## the Unity engine due to its ease with built-in shader support. In this program, the user can zoom in to the infamous Mandelbrot set, or skew the variables in the equation and ## explore a fractal of their making.
